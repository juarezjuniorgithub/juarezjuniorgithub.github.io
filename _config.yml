  My name is Juarez Barbosa Junior, and I have over 20 years of professional experience in Software Engineering and Developer Relations.
  I have held senior leadership roles in developer relations, developer ecosystem outreach, developer community management, business development and strategy, software and solutions engineering, collaboration with developer communities, startup founders, accelerators, incubators, mentors, venture capitalists, subject matter experts, and business partners.
  
  I am a Sr. Principal Java Developer Evangelist and Director of Developer Evangelism at Oracle. Previously, I was an Azure Developer Relations Lead – Director of Developer Relations at Microsoft.
  In addition to that, I was a Principal Developer Advocate, Developer Advocacy Director at Oracle EMEA, and a Thought Leader and Technical Evangelist at IBM.
     
  I have experience engaging the C-Level in technology and business transformation journeys, aiming at explaining complex business and technology-related scenarios to technical and non-technical audiences.
  From a technical standpoint, I am an expert in Java language, JDK, and JVMs (Java Virtual Machines). 
  
  I have extensive experience and knowledge in Cloud Computing (Oracle OCI, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud, and AWS), DevOps, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Continuous Integration / Delivery (CI/CD), and Cloud Native. Also, I am a polyglot Software Engineer with experience in Java, Kotlin, Golang, Python, C, C++, and Javascript, and lately, I have been learning Rust.
  
  I've also acted as a Mentor for Microsoft for Startups. IBM has nominated me as an IBM Technical Rock Star for Cloud, IBM Redbooks Thought Leader, Technical Evangelist for IBM Mobile, and Nokia Developer Champion. 
  
  I have received awards - IBM Manager Choice Award, Superior Community Service Contributions - Forum Nokia Wiki, IBM Hall of Fame Awards, IBM Common Development, Test Outstanding Contribution Awards, and IBM Mobile Enterprise Social Media Residency - Outstanding Contributor.
  
  Feel free to invite me to speak about Java, Microservices, Software Architecture, Solutions Architecture, DevOps, Cloud Computing (Oracle Cloud, Azure, AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud), Emerging Technologies (IoT, AI, Blockchain, XR), and Cybersecurity.

            I am playing a leadership role responsible for developer evangelism execution at a global level. I'm responsible for strategy and developer outreach activities comprising developers (communities, meetups, JUGs - Java User Groups, 3rd-party conferences), social media strategy related to technical content and technology conferences, and customer-focused engagements from a technical standpoint. 
            Besides, the developer evangelism motions also comprise developing new code samples, hands-on labs (Oracle LiveLabs - tech workshops), customer-facing demos, content creation (blog posts, videos) highlighting developer tooling and various Java-related and Open-Source projects.
